## 1. Overview

</p>
We present MathVC, the very first LLM-powered virtual classroom containing multiple LLM-simulated student characters, with whom a human student can practice their Mathematics Modeling skill. The effectiveness of the simulation approach was confirmed and the promise for MathVC to benefit real-life students in the future was shown in the paper.

An example demonstrating the application of MathVC, where students are presented a math problem (optionally with accompanied data) and engage in effective discussions on math modeling. Alice, Bob, and Charlie are LLM-simulated student characters. A human student can choose to respond or skip the current turn.

Code and demo will be released soon!
